# 03_personal_library_manager
This is my Personal_Library_Manager by using Python..





This Personal Library Management System built with Streamlit allows users to:

View Library: See all added books with details like title, author, genre, publication year, and read status. Users can also mark books as read/unread or remove them.

Add a Book: Enter details to add a new book (title, author, genre, etc.) to the library.

Search Books: Search for books based on title, author, or genre.

Library Statistics: View statistics like total books, books read, genre distribution, and more, along with interactive visualizations like pie and bar charts.

The system uses session state to store and update data, and JSON files to persist the library data between sessions. The app also includes custom CSS for styling and Lottie animations for a smooth UI experience.
